## [Project brief](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Marking_up_a_letter#project_brief)

For this project, your task is to mark up a letter that needs to be hosted on a university intranet. The letter is a response from a research fellow to a prospective PhD student concerning their application to the university.

### [Block/structural semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Marking_up_a_letter#blockstructural_semantics)

- Use appropriate document structure including doctype, and [`<html>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html), [`<head>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head) and [`<body>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body) elements.
- In general, the letter should be marked up as an organization of headings and paragraphs, with the following exception. There is one top level heading (the "Re:" line) and three second level headings.
- Use an appropriate list type to mark up the semester start dates, study subjects, and exotic dances.
- Put the two addresses inside [`<address>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address) elements. Each line of the address should sit on a new line, but not be in a new paragraph.

### [Inline semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Marking_up_a_letter#inline_semantics)

- The names of the sender and receiver (and _Tel_ and _Email_ ) should be marked up with strong importance.
- The four dates in the document should have appropriate elements containing machine-readable dates.
- The first address and first date in the letter should have a class attribute value of _sender-column_ . The CSS you'll add later will cause these to be right aligned, as it should be in the case in a classic letter layout.
- Mark up the following five acronyms/abbreviations in the main text of the letter — "PhD," "HTML," "CSS," "BC," and "Esq." — to provide expansions of each one.
- The six sub/superscripts should be marked up appropriately — in the chemical formulae, and the numbers 103 and 104 (they should be 10 to the power of 3 and 4, respectively).
- Try to mark up at least two appropriate words in the text with strong importance/emphasis.
- There are two places where the letter should have a hyperlink. Add appropriate links with titles. For the location that the links point to, you may use `http://univelcity.com` as the URL.
- Mark up the university motto quote and citation with appropriate elements.

### [The head of the document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Marking_up_a_letter#the_head_of_the_document)

- The character set of the document should be set as utf-8 using the appropriate meta tag.
- The author of the letter should be specified in an appropriate meta tag.
- The provided CSS should be included inside an appropriate tag.

## [Hints and tips](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Marking_up_a_letter#hints_and_tips)

- Use the [W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate your HTML. Award yourself bonus points if it validates.
- You don't need to know any CSS to do this assignment. You just need to put the provided CSS inside an HTML element.
